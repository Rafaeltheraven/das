# Das

The domestic authentication service, or DAS for short (name pending) is an authentication service specifically designed for domestic self-hosting.
This means it supports the maximum variety of client applications, while including the minimum amount of enterprise functionality.

It supports client applications via OAuth, LDAP, and Authelia-style reverse proxy authentication.
The project is written in Elixir, which means it should use relatively few resources, and more importantly remain available even under very high load.
